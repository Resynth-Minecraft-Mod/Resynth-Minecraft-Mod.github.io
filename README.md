The Resynth Minecraft Mod enables growing and farming ores and other non-renewable resources in vanilla and modded Minecraft by adding different plant crops that can grow ores, mob drops, and various other resources.

Beyond just getting seeds and growing ores and resources, Resynth also adds some nice features and mechanics. First, a new type of farmland for Resynth crops that can be enriched with Mineral Rock to speed up the growth rate of plants. Crop Farms can be made fully automatic either with Hoppers or with vanilla auto-farming mechanics. Plant produce can be destroyed for a chance to get more seeds. A type of flower that spawns randomly throughout the world which can drop Biochemical seeds for players in peaceful mode so that they can grow mod drops. And so much more!
